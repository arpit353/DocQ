              <span style="font-size:25px" class="card-title">Q: Will a person with Type 2 diabetes under control end up with the need for insulin?</span>
              <p>As you may have read, Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease. Will you require insulin? That all depends on individual factors that includes, among many other factors, weight, exercise, genetics, hormones and beta-cells, those cells that produce insulin in your pancreas. Research shows that managing your diabetes early in the disease process can have big payoffs in later years. Joining a support group for people with diabetes can be helpful in keeping you going in your health quest. Following up with your health care team regularly and keeping abreast on the new developments in diabetes management can also benefit you.<br>Answered by Andrea Dunn, RD, LD, CDE: Andrea Dunn is a registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator with the Center for Human Nutrition.</p>

              <span style="font-size:25px" class="card-title">Q: Is there a genetic factor to strokes?</span>
              <p>Yes. There are genetic factors. There are some people that are born with certain genes that predispose them to stroke. One such condition would be CADASIL (cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy). If you are interested, I am sure you can learn more about this condition from the Web. Some people are born with genetic conditions that predispose them to clotting. This in turn may increase their stroke risk. Finally, if you have a strong family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol or any of the major modifiable risk factors for stroke, you may also be at higher risk because of this. However, these particular conditions are very much treatable and you certainly can do something about them to lower your risk.<br>Answered by Efrain Salgado, MD: Dr. Salgado is Director of the Cleveland Clinic Florida Stroke Center and Neurosonology Laboratory and Director of the Neurology Residency Training Program at Cleveland Clinic Florida. </p>

              <p>Most women who get breast cancer do not have any family history of breast cancer. Just because a family member had breast cancer does not always mean that you will get breast cancer.We do know that there are some genes associated with a known increased risk of breast cancer. These are BRCA 1 (breast cancer 1, early onset human tumor suppressor gene) and BRCA 2 (breast cancer type 2, susceptibility protein). Only 10 percent of women with breast cancer have these inherited genes. These women usually get breast cancer at a young age and have multiple family members with breast or ovarian cancer.<br>Answered by Stephanie Valente, DO.

She is a board certified general surgeon with fellowship training in surgical breast oncology and serves as the Associate Director of the Cleveland Clinic Breast Fellowship. </p>
